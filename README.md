# MyPostcardApp

Welcome to the PostcardApp! This project efficiently handles postcards and associated information. The system consists of two main components:

## REST API Server

The backend is powered by a robust REST API developed using Python Flask. It serves as the core server, managing the application's database. Users can either be created within the system or log in via Google authentication. Each user has references to their owned postcards, and all essential CRUD operations for postcards are seamlessly implemented.

### Technologies Used:
- Python Flask for REST API
- SQLite database for efficient data storage

## Desktop Client Application

The frontend is a user-friendly desktop client application crafted using custom tkinter and tkinter libraries. This application provides a smooth and intuitive interface for managing the API. Users can seamlessly switch between different languages and modes (light/dark) to suit their preferences. The desktop client adheres to UI/UX standards, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing experience.

### Technologies Used:
- CustomTkinter and Tkinter for the desktop application
- Responsive design following UI/UX standards
